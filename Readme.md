#Salha Saad Gender Gap in Europe: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute

Project Purpose: 
This is an interactive frontend development milestone project in which I have highlighted the gender gap difference across several European countires in terms of the labor market representation of both women and men, the pay gap and the difference in both participation in caring responsibilites and social activities. I have used d3.js library to build number of functions to draw multiple charts where these differences could be seen. The data for this project have been downloaded from the eurostat statistic explained website and have been averaged across 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2015.


UX design and Information Architecture: 
The features, design and coloring scheme across the four pages were kept consistent and uniformed for the purpose of ease of use and navigation. The navigation bar was designed to be to the side of the webpage with toggle button for a full or minimazed view. On the home page there is a short introduction to the study's data and its source. Then the viewer will have the choice of scrolling through the list under the statistic section whether to look at representation gap or salary gap or social gap. Under each of these section there will be a summary on the results as well as a chart demonstrating these differences. Sometimes they will be a button to display men and women results separately. Some of the plots are also dynamic, responsive and show different part of the data when the mouse is hovered over them. I have made sure that the color scheme of different cateogories in all of the charts and typography were recycled across this project.  


Code Quality:
As this is an interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project, javascript especially d3.js libaray have been haveily used to draw and visiulaze the data. The code has been inclosed within the function whenever possible that was later called from within html element. Wherever possible these function were generlized through passing parameters names. I have also used a lot jQuary to target specific html elements. Some of chart's drawing code been borrowed but I have made a major a changes on them. Some functions contain specific code to allow for dynamic and responsive desgin and selective data visulization. In the css file,some of the styling was either newly created or overwriting to achieve the desired look of the features.  


Version control:

I have asked few people for a feedback on my website in terms of its relevancy and clarity. The feedback was good and the website achieved the intended outcome of providing a summary on the gender gap in Europe. One of the feedback was that my website layout and features are presented in the most concise and meaningful way. They can view both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are also able to download source code by clicking on the download button on the nav bar of each page. All clickable button have been checked to insure that the correct data type are being displayed. All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox). I have validated both html files and css file on Markup Validation Service and made the suggested adjustment accordingly. This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html. To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://plxsas.github.io/SecondMileStoneProject/ into your terminal. Finally readme file is written to explain what are the main features of this project and how they have been deployed. 


I have used some of the code from these website but I have made some changes on them.
