#Salha Saad Gender Gap in Europe: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute

Project Purpose: This is an interactive frontend development milestone project in which I have highlighted the gender gap difference across several European countires in terms of the labor market representation of both women and men, the pay gap and the difference regarding their participation in caring responsibilites and social activities. I have used d3.js library to build number of functions to draw multiple charts where these differences could be seen. The data for this project have been downloaded from the eurostat statistic explained website and have been averaged across 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2015.
